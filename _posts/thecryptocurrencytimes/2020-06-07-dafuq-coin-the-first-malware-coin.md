The above picture is an actual image released by the developer when Dafuq Coin was first announced, and ended up being an allusion to the true nature of Dafuq Coin. Dafuq Coin was a scrypt crypto currency, offering nothing unique besides its silly name. Despite this, many people joined the Dafuq Coin community and began mining it, and several exchanges added Dafuq Coin. This is another example of how you can make a coin with any name, and no matter how useless it is it will attract attention.

Within 24 hours of launch the first problems arose. First, it was realized that the amount of coins being mined per day was much lower than it was supposed to be, meaning the code was incorrect. More importantly, the coin forked, which means the blockchain split into 2 different chains. This results in coin losses since the coins generated on the wrong chain don’t count, and anyone sending coins during this time can lose them. A fork is one of the worst things that can happen to a Cryptocurrency, and requires quick attention from the developer.

Much worse news soon came out, thanks to the investigative work of the owner of Bittrex, who was about to add Dafuq Coin to his exchange. The Dafuq Coin wallet installed a rootkit on any server it was put on, giving the ‘developer’ complete control of the server. This means that any pool or exchange that added Dafuq Coin was at a high risk of being hacked.

talesfromthescrypt.com was the first to be hacked. It was a new and popular mining pool, and all of the coins were stolen from the pool. Not just Dafuq Coins, but every single coin in every single pool on talefromthescrypt’s servers. This resulted in untold thousands of dollars of loss for the miners and pool owner, resulting in mass confusion and anger in the community.

Cryptokk, which is a small exchange, was robbed blind due to Dafuq Coin, and all coins on the exchange were lost. Cryptokk was forced to close, and customers of the exchange and its owner lost unknown amounts of money.

Additionally, everyone who spent money or mining power on Dafuq Coin lost 100% of their investment, Dafuq Coin became worthless after these events. It was no longer tradable.

Thus, Dafuq Coin was the first known malware coin, it’s sole purpose was to hack pools and exchanges, and perhaps even personal computers, in order to steal coins and make a quick buck for the ‘developer’.

The answer to the developers question “Dafud did I just mined?” is malware apparently. Hopefully this leads to pool owners and exchanges doing more thorough security checks before putting new coins on their servers.
