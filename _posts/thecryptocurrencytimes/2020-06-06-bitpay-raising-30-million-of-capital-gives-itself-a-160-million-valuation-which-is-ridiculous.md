BitPay is a payment service that allows merchants to accept Bitcoin. BitPay is by far the largest service for accepting Bitcoin payments, and it is becoming quite popular. 30,000 merchants now use BitPay, including big names like Virgin Galactic, Zynga, and WordPress. Accepting Bitcoin payments is quite attractive for merchants, since there is absolutely no chargeback risk, and payments are near-instant. BitPay converts the Bitcoins to cash for merchants, which can then be deposited into their bank account.

BitPay is raising another $30 million of capital through Index Ventures, which will make BitPay the Bitcoin company with the most financing, ahead of Coinbase, rival Circle, and Xapo.

The $30 million investing round is going to be based on a valuation for BitPay of $160 million, which is a ridiculous valuation. BitPay processed $100 million of Bitcoin payments in the last year, which is impressive, but with their fees of 1% that only comes out to $1 million of profit. They do charge merchants fees for using BitPay of $30-300, so perhaps they make another $1 million through user fees.  The $160 million valuation is easily 50-100 times overpriced, making this round of investing not very profitable for investors. Perhaps BitPay will have a real valuation over $100 million sometime in the future, but probably not anytime soon.

Although $100 million of transactions sounds impressive, Visa, one of the world’s largest credit card processors, has transaction volumes in the trillions of dollars. This gives Visa a valuation of $130 billion, which is alot more realistic than BitPay’s valuation.
