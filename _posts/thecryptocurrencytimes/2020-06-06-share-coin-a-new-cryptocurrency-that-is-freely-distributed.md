Share Coin is a brand new Cryptocurrency that came out within the past week. It is similar to Fair Coin, since all Share Coins are freely distributed to anyone who asks for them. This distribution occurred to members of Bitcointalk only, which is by far the most popular Cryptocurrency forum. Thousands of members applied, and today each member who applied received a little over 65,300 Share Coins.

There are 100 million Share Coins total, meaning that everyone who applied got 0.065% of all Share Coins. Share Coin is Proof of Stake (PoS), meaning you get free coins just for keeping your wallet open.  Share Coin will not be mined, rather the network will be run through everyone’s computer who has a Share Coin wallet open. This is much more energy efficient than coins which rely on powerful computers to mine them.

A Share Coin multipool is launching soon. This multipool will mine the most profitable Cryptocurrencies, and then buy Share Coin with the proceeds. This will help increase the value of Share Coin on the exchanges. Black Coin and Fair Coin are prominent examples of how a multipool can drastically increase a PoS coin’s price.

Also, the developers of Share Coin are opening a Cryptocurrency exchange, and they say holding Share Coin will give you a chance to earn a percentage of the revenue from this exchange. They are also opening a gambling site, and the revenue from that will also be distributed to Share Coin holders. Neither the gambling site or the exchange are open yet though.

Share Coin already has a very active community, with over 100 pages of discussion on Bitcointalk: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=587051.0>{:target="\_blank"} This is an excellent sign, many people want to see Share Coin succeed.

The one thing Share Coin is missing is an exchange where you can trade it, but that will likely change shortly. I think a few Cryptocurrency exchanges will add Share Coin considering its popularity. Despite the lack of exchanges, people are already buying and selling Share Coin to each other. Someone bought 65,300 Share Coins today for 0.1 Bitcoin ($45) from one of the people who received free Share Coin during the distribution.
